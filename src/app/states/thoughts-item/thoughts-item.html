                        white-labeled relationships fail?

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I should start with the fact that I always hated «outsourcing» word - I can’t understand how
                        being an outsourcing software development company might be a business goal. There are a lot
                        of companies (particularly in Ukraine) who proudly position themselves as
                        «outsourcing companies» and consider that part of their branding strategy (moreover there are
                        even communities and successfully running conferences utilising this word). All right that may
                        be a good start for a company just established, that is also a good way to keep your developers
                        busy but that can’t be a permanent and ultimate goal (in my humble opinion at least).

                        «outsourcing» in software world - proving development or other digital services under
                        white-label agreement, essentially doing someone’s work instead of them. Let’s consider a few

                        I totally respect the reasons and I can also accept the solution in the first case - it might
                        happen that you are hiring a company similar to yours and it wouldn’t be wise enough to
                        introduce your competitor to your client. Moreover that looks more like resolving a temporary
                        issue than a way you build your business. However, the 2nd case is what often happens on a
                        permanent basis and becomes a long-term relationship. I am totally confident that it’s a bad
